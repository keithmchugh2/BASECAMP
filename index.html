        <p class="eyebrow">Why BASECAMP</p>
        <h2>Most people do not fail from lack of effort. They fail from lack of a system.</h2>
        <p>
          Motivation fades. Discipline stays. BASECAMP gives you a clear process,
          daily action, and direct accountability so progress is measurable week after week.
